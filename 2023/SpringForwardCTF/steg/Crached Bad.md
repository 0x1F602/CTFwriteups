## Challenge

> It was all so peaceful, the drive out to Indiana, and it was going great until some guy hit me and then took off. I went to send a picture of the damange to my mechanic, and it got all pixilated and messed up when he got it. Oh well. I hope he finds what the car needs to be fixed.
